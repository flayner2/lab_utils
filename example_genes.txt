! Lines starting with a "!" will be treated as comments and will be ignored.
! Each gene should be separated into #gene blocks, which need to be identified.
! The identifiers will be used to generate the names for the output files when
! using the "-o" flag and they must match those in the exclusions file.

! Text without "!" and outside a #gene block (like the one below) is ignored.
error

! Blank lines like the one above are ignored.
! Each gene block starts with #gene, a space and an identifier (any string or number).
#gene rrna_18S
! Any number of terms, separated by line, may be inside a gene block.
! Comments may also be inside a gene block.
18S
small subunit ribosomal

! Blank lines don't separate gene blocks from one another. They are ignored.
! Use blank lines for your own visual clarity.

#gene rrna_28S
! Gene names are case-insensitive.
28S
large subunit ribosomal

! Case doesn't matter for #gene blocks, and spaces after the "#" are allowed.
! But spaces (any number of them) between #gene and the identifier is mandatory.
